## How to use?
The app is used in your favorite browser. You can keep track of the books you
are currently reading, want to read or have already read.
Bookshelves can be changed via the dropdown menu - click on the green button. To
search for new books, click on the add button. When you have found something
that interest you, simply sort it into the right bookshelf via the dropdown menu.
Enjoy reading!
